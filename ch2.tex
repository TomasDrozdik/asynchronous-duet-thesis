\chapter{Duet benchmarking}
\label{chap:duet}

GOAL: Determine if new version of software introduced a performance regression based on software benchmarks.


\section{Software Benchmarks}

How are benchmarks structured?

Benchmark stages: setup, main loop, verify, teardown.

What are the scores/metrics that we obtain from selected benchmarks? - absolute time.

Some benchmarks output other "final number" metrics - possibly mention how to include them.


\section{Duet benchmark}

Describe Synchronous Duet benchmarking - \citet{bulej2020duet}.

What are A/A and A/B runs?


Why it makes sense to relax the synchronous iteration assumption?


\section{Asynchronous duet}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Basics - run 2 dockers in parallel, copy results to host, process results
	\item Implications of using Docker:
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item running in VM / host
		      \item resource sharing and scheduling fairness - Completely Fair Scheduler
		      \item resource monitoring
	      \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Research questions}

\begin{description}
	\item[RQ1] What is the variance of asynchronous-duet compared to synchronous duet and sequential execution?
	\item[RQ2] How does choice of environment affect the variance? - \citet{laaber2019software}
	\item[RQ3] What are the effects of duet benchmarking on run time and costs?
	\item[RQ4] What categories of benchmarks and statistical methods, are viable for asynchronous-duet method. (stretch goal?)
