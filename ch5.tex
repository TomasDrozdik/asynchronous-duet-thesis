\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}

Describe what has been measured and where.

\section{Experiment Setup}
\label{sec:experiment_setup}

\subsection{Selected benchmarks}

What benchmarks are in the study and why?

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Renaissance suite
  \item ScalaBench/DaCappo suite
  \item SpecCPU
\end{enumerate}

Description of what they do. Either reference them and describe few that we will pick later.

\subsection{Benchmark Configuration}
\label{sec:benchmark_configuration}

Describe how were the benchmarks configured (1) heap parameters (2) validation checks and other options passed to suite harnesses.
Note that SPECcpu prohibits publication of results without verification but reason why this is the case.

\subsection{Selected platforms}

Describe what platforms were picked, why and what was their configuration.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Dedicated server
  \item On-prem private cloud - DigitalOcean
  \item AWS - different configurations
  \item Personal laptop? - to illustrate usability in general developer workflow
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Run summary}

Number of benchmarks run in different configurations as well as different methods used - asynchronous/synchronous duet, sequential.
