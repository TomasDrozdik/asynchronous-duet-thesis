\chapter{Implementation}

Describe asynchronous duet harness \footnote{\url{https://github.com/TomasDrozdik/asynchronous-duet}}.


\section{Asynchronous duet method}

Brief intor to usage of the \lstinline{duetbench.py}.

What is the algorithm?

Example of configuration and usage.

Refer to docs \xxx{ref} for full user documentation.


\section{Other benchmarking methods}

Describe that in order to make comparisons harness supports sequential runs as well as synchronous duets (just need the right docker image).
