\chapter{Overview of Results Processing}
\label{chap:results}

Essentially: describe data manipulation and statistics in the analysis notebooks.


\section{Data filtering}

\begin{description}
    \item[Outliers] how to deal with outliers
    \item[Warmup] how to determine warmup time, in particullar for Java benchmarks
    \item[Windsorization]
\end{description}


\section{Pre-processing}

Processing results of benchmarks into standardized format - CSV for further analysis.

How and what metrics does the harness gather?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Absolute iteration start-end time
    \item Overlap
    \item Weighted Overlap
    \item Other...
\end{enumerate}


\section{Varience analysis}

Address each used statistical method.
Bootstrapping, Confidence intervals and tests.

Describe utilization of A/A runs and A/B runs on known regressions.
